Generators generate code.

Some are big and produce entire libraries for Restful APIs, models and other robust services. Others are small and only produce a single file such as a [README.md](/gen/readme), [AUTHORS](/gen/authors) or [.gitignore](/gen/gitignore) file.

They can work together or alone. They can have one purpose or many. They can be public or private. And they can be created from scratch or added to an existing project.

Generators are what make `crystal` useful to you and others. So use them. Make them. Make a lot of them. Then make generators for your generators and generators for your generators' generators.
