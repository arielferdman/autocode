Artificial intelligence was created the moment the first line of code was written. Now it's written in C#, PHP & JavaScript.

Our goal is to perfect code: to embrace the creativity and unique ideas of various languages, frameworks and scripts, and make it as efficient, re-usable and intelligent as possible.
